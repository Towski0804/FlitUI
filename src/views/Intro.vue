    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Flit UI is a UI component library based on Vue 3 and TypeScript.</p>
    <p>
      This component library is a summary of my technical experience over the
      years. It is written from scratch, without relying on third-party
      libraries.

      <strong
        >While I discourage using this UI library in a production
        environment,</strong

      it is worth exploring the source code. The source code is available on
      <a href="https://github.com/Towski0804/FlitUI">Github</a> with
      well-organized commit history. You can review the commits in chronological
      order or directly view the source code and examples of each component.
      Instructions for running the library can be found in the README.md file.
