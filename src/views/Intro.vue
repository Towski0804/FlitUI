    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Flit UI is a UI component library based on Vue 3 and TypeScript.</p>
    <p>
      This component library is actually a summary of my technical experience
      over the years. I have personally written it from scratch, trying to avoid
      using third-party libraries. Even the website you are currently viewing is
      mostly my own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I strongly discourage you from using this UI library in a
      production environment. However, if you are here to explore the source
      code, then this library is worth a look. The source code is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/Towski0804/FlitUI">Github</a>, with
      well-organized commit history. You can go through the commits in
      chronological order, or directly view the source code and examples of each
      component. Instructions for running the library can be found in the
      README.md file.
